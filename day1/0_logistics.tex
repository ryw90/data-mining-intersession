\frametitle{Course logistics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The goal of the course is to introduce the basic concepts of data mining and teach you to work with structured data.
	\item You can do some data analysis in point-and-click applications like MS Excel or Tableau, but most work (e.g. data wrangling or predictive modeling) will require some basic programming.
	\item We will use the statistical programming language R, which is heavily used in both industry and academia. Other popular options are Python, SAS, and SQL.
	\item Each day we'll (roughly) spend:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Half the time teaching concepts by working through examples
		\item 30 minutes on break, watching the movie Moneyball
		\item Rest of the time exploring datasets that we've prepared
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Course materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All course materials will be hosted on GitHub
	\item This will include datasets, lecture notes, lecture code, and links to external resources
	\item Link: \url{https://github.com/ryw90/data-mining-intersession}

\frametitle{What is data mining?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data mining is the process of extracting insights and understanding from data
	\item Revolutions in computing have drastically lowered the cost of collecting, storing, and analyzing data, which has led to big changes in industry, academia, and government:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Facebook uses social data to predict "People you may know"
		\item Retailers (e.g. Amazon and Target) use your purchasing history to advertise other relevant products
		\item TO DO: Academia
		\item City of Chicago uses crime data to target police patrols (\href{http://dssg.io/projects/}{link})
		\item Federal government has released over 80,000 datasets since 2009 on \url{http://data.gov}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
