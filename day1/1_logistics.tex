\frametitle{What is data mining?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Data mining is the process of extracting insights and understanding from data
	\item Revolutions in computing have drastically lowered the cost of collecting, storing, and analyzing data
	\item The list of influential applications is really long. For example:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Search engines e.g. Google
		\item Sensor-driven devices e.g. self-driving cars
		\item Recommenders e.g. Amazon or Netflix
		\item Responsive systems e.g. smart grid
		\item Fraud detection
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Course structure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The goal of the course is to introduce the basic concepts of data mining and teach you to work with structured data
	\item The best way to learn is by answering questions you find interesting! 
	\item As such we will break up into teams of 3 to work on projects (Scott and I have prepared a number of datasets), and the last day will be devoted to presenting your findings as a team
	\item The daily schedule will be (roughly):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 45 minutes of lecture
		\item 45 minutes of working through an example
		\item 30 minutes of break (to watch the movie Moneyball)
		\item 60 minutes of self-directed project work
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Course materials}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All course materials will be hosted on Dropbox
	\item This will include datasets, lecture notes, sample code, and links to external resources
	\item Link: \url{https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bpl1oz5fkx3ml1s/rJVUljAoNC}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Getting R}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will be using the open-source statistical programming language R, which is used heavily in both academia and industry for data analysis
	\item We will also use RStudio, an interactive development environment which makes programming in R much easier
	\item Download R here: \url{http://www.r-project.org/}
	\item Download RStudio here: \url{http://www.rstudio.com/}
\end{itemize}
